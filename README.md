# Overview

{Description and usage instructions go here}

My goal for creating this app, is to build something I can actually release to the public that I might actually use. More specifically, I want to build something I would be willing to use. I believe that if I am to truly build and demonstrate my skills as a developer, then I need to build something with the intention of releasing it for use in the general public. I would not call myself a writer if I had not published a book. Why would I treat my programming any different. Additionally, I want to prove that I can build a program that someone not using an IDE could actually use and enjoy, and while I am at it, showcase my ability to learn new technologies and my ability to further my knowledge of existing programming languages.
