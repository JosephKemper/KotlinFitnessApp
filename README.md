# Overview

This app is meant to serve as a reminder for you of what workouts you plan to do each day. You can create custom exercises within it by first creating a workout to place your exercise in, and then creating an exercise to add to your workout. One workout can have multiple exercises. 

My goal for creating this app, is to build something I can actually release to the public that I might actually use. More specifically, I want to build something I would be willing to use. I believe that if I am to truly build and demonstrate my skills as a developer, then I need to build something with the intention of releasing it for use in the general public. I would not call myself a writer if I had not published a book. Why would I treat my programming any different. Additionally, I want to prove that I can build a program that someone not using an IDE could actually use and enjoy, and while I am at it, showcase my ability to learn new technologies and my ability to further my knowledge of existing programming languages.
